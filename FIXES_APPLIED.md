# ChatBot Fixes Applied

## Issue
The chatbot was refusing to answer questions about ReCircle's services and differentiators, responding with:
> "I am sorry, I cannot provide information about the services ReCircle offers."

## Root Cause
The LLM refiner had overly restrictive guidelines that prevented the bot from answering ReCircle company questions:
- Guideline 13: "For company queries (about ReCircle): Do NOT add any contact promotion"
- Guideline 14: "Focus only on EPR and plastic waste topics"

These guidelines made the bot think ReCircle service questions were off-topic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `API/llm_refiner.py`
**Lines 110-114**: Changed restrictive guidelines to supportive ones:

**Before:**
```python
'13. For company queries (about ReCircle): Do NOT add any contact promotion\n'
'14. Focus only on EPR and plastic waste topics\n'
```

**After:**
```python
'13. ANSWER ALL ReCircle service questions: Explain ReCircle offers end-to-end EPR compliance including registration, certificates, waste management, and reporting\n'
'14. For "what makes ReCircle different": Highlight comprehensive service, technology platform, pan-India network, compliance expertise\n'
'15. ReCircle questions are ALWAYS relevant - answer them fully and positively\n'
```

**Line 217**: Updated company query detection to allow service-related questions:

**Before:**
```python
is_company_query = any(word in query.lower() for word in ['what is recircle', 'about recircle', 'recircle company', 'recircle different'])
```

**After:**
```python
is_company_query = any(word in query.lower() for word in ['what is recircle', 'about recircle', 'recircle company']) and not any(word in query.lower() for word in ['service', 'help', 'different', 'offer'])
```

### 2. Enhanced `API/search.py`
**Lines 56-103**: Expanded `get_recircle_info()` function with comprehensive responses:

- **Services queries**: Lists all 7 ReCircle services
- **Differentiation queries**: Highlights 8 unique advantages
- **Help queries**: Details 6 support areas
- **General queries**: Provides company overview

**Lines 330-338**: Updated ReCircle query handling to respond to ALL ReCircle questions:

**Before:**
```python
if is_recircle_query and is_contact_query:
    recircle_info = get_recircle_info(user_query)
    answer = recircle_info
```

**After:**
```python
if is_recircle_query:
    recircle_info = get_recircle_info(user_query)
    if answer and len(answer) > 50:
        answer = f"{recircle_info}\n\n{answer}"
    else:
        answer = recircle_info
```
